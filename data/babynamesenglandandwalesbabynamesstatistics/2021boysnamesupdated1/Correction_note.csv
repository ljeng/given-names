"We have corrected an error in table 2 of this workbook (Top 100 names for baby boys, England, 2021)."
"The previous version of this table showed two entries for the name Mohammed, which ranked as the 33rd most popular boys name in England."
The second entry was a duplicate and it was displayed in error. It has been deleted in this corrected version of table 2.
This happened because of a technical fault when producing the table.
