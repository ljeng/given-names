1 These rankings have been produced using the exact spelling of the name given at birth registration. Similar names with different spellings have been counted separately. ,,,,,,,,,,,
2 The sum of the counts for individual names in Table 2 and Table 3 may not equal the count in Table 1; this is because births where the usual residence of mother was not stated at the time of registration have been excluded from the counts in Table 2 and Table 3.,,,,,,,,,,,
