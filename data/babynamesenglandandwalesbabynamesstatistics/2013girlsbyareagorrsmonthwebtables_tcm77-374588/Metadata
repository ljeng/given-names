Introduction
Annual baby name statistics represent the names given to those live births occurring in England and Wales in a given year. Birth registration is a legal requirement under the Births and Deaths Registration Act (1836). The registration of births occurring in England and Wales is a service carried out by the Local Registration Service in partnership with the General Register Office (GRO). Information collected at birth registration is recorded on a Registration Online (RON) system by registrars. Most of the information is normally supplied by the parent(s). The spelling of the name is checked with those registering the birth before the data are submitted.
Notes and definitions
Baby name statistics do not include births to women usually resident in England or Wales who give birth abroad. They do include births to women whose usual residence is outside England and Wales where the birth occurred in England or Wales.
Births where the name of the baby is not stated are excluded from all the ranks. Births where the usual residence of the mother was not in England and Wales are excluded from the regional ranks and from the separate England and Wales ranks.
"The published ranks have been produced using exact spelling of first names given on the birth certificate. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the ranks. Although some groupings are straightforward, others are more a matter of opinion, and thus raw data are given so users can group if they wish."
Names with a count of 2 or less in total within England and Wales have been redacted using S40 of the Freedom of Information Act in order to protect the confidentiality of individuals. This is consistent with the disclosure control methodology used for births. Further information on the ONS policy for protecting confidentiality within birth statistics can be found on the ONS website:
